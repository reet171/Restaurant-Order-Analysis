Analyse Restaurant menu items and to make data-driven decisions about which menu items to keep, remove, or introduce in the new menu to cater to customer preferences and improve sales for the next year.

1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu.
2. Explore the order_details table to get an idea of the data that's been collected.
3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu.

## Questions to solve the Problem
